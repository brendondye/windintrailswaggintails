			<p>Hello, animal lovers! <span id="bestToKnow">My name is Brendon and I'm dedicated to providing the best care possible for your furry family members. With prior experience working in veterinary offices, I've gained invaluable knowledge and skills to ensure your pet's well-being.</span> I have a deep-rooted passion for animals, and it's reflected in the love and attention I give to each pet in my care. It's not just a career; it's a calling!</p>
			<p>I'm proud to be a pet parent to an English Cream Golden Retriever who can vouch for my expertise! We love taking adventurous hikes, exploring local trails, and cooling off with refreshing swims at the lake. I extend this active lifestyle to the pets in my care, offering activities from jogging to more laid-back playtime in the backyard, all tailored to you and your pet's preferences.</p>
			<p>I offer a flexible schedule to fit your needs and enjoy spending time outdoors, which means more fun and exercise for your pup. Feel free to reach out by <a href="#contact">call, text, or email</a> anytime to discuss how I can make your life easier and your pet's life happier.</p>

					<p aria-describedby="eileenT">"Brendon is easily the best dog sitter/walker I have ever had! I have a sweet, but overly energetic husky named Ghost and every other walker I've tried has said that they feel a little overwhelmed by him. So when Brendon showed up, it was a saving grace. Every time he comes through the door Ghost is so excited and you can tell that Brendon is his friend. I trust him completely and love to see the care he gives to my baby. The only complaint I have is I think Ghost likes Brendon more than me now! Definitely the person you want looking out for your fur baby!"</p>

He is a huge animal lover, and that's so obvious with the way he takes care of our dogs, as if they were his own. I would not hesitate in recommending Brendon to take care of any of your pets!"</p>
